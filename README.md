# Odds Fetcher

This script fetches odds from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/).

## Usage

1. Set an environment variable with your API key:

```bash
export THE_ODDS_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

2. Run the script (moneyline odds shown by default):

```bash
python main.py
```

To display point spread (handicap) odds, run:

```bash
python main.py spreads
```

The script requests both head-to-head and point spread markets. It prints the
API endpoint used and displays odds for the selected market in a clean layout.
